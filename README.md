# Node.js Server Hangs on Unhandled Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications where the server hangs due to unhandled errors during request processing.  The `server.js` file shows the problematic code, while `serverSolution.js` provides a corrected version using error handling middleware. 

Unhandled errors can lead to unresponsive servers and lost connections.  Proper error handling is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of Node.js applications.
